# Athena-Queries
AWS Athena and other Query Examples


One of the most complicated queries i had to write was for my capstone project. It involved 3 tables, calls, customer and web tracks. I had to :
-combine all 3
-find the number of web tracks before each call
-find the number of call interactions against each customer
-append the call data against only the first call

The business problem behind the query involved the data to train a machine learning model to predict the probability of repeated calls by a customer. Customers with higher probability could be target proactively to increase customer experience and reduce call center costs.

Overall, the query involved a significant number of subqueries, joins and reqular expressions.
